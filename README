Locator
=======

Automatically set your Mac's location based on the currently-joined SSID, or
the ability to resolve one or more hostnames.

locator works by running as a daemon, and waking up every time your computer's
network interface(s) change state in some way. It runs through each configured
location detection snippet, and determines what Location to select. It sets
your Mac's Location to the most appropriate choice, or to "Automatic" if
nothing matched.


Installation
------------

As root:

   1. Clone or copy locator to /Library/Locator
   2. Copy 'ca.watkiss.locator.plist' to /Library/LaunchDaemons
   3. Start locator: sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/ca.watkiss.locator.plist
   4. Add one or more Location snippets (see below)

If you choose to install locator to a directory other than /Library/Locator,
you will need to adjust the path in the plist file.


Configuration
-------------

Locations are configured by creating subdirectories in /Library/Locator. For
example, if you want Locator to switch your Mac's Location to "Work" based on
some criteria, you should create a directory called "Work":

   /Library/Locator/Work

Inside each Location directory, locator looks for two files:

   - SSID: contains wireless SSIDs, one per line. If the Mac is
     currently connected to one of these SSIDs, locator will select this
     location.

   - DNS: contains DNS names to resolve, one per line. They do not have to be
     fully-qualified; they just have to resolve. If any of the listed
     hostnames resolve, locator will select this location.
